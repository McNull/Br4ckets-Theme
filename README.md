## Supported Editors
* TextMate
* Sublime Text 2
* Sublime Text 3
* Redcar (Uses TextMate Themes)
* E TextEditor (Uses TextMate Themes)

## Language Support
The theme has been designed to be language independent and should look great with any language. 
However, if you find this isn't the case, just send me some sample code and I'll try to fix it!

## The Future?
I may be releasing other variations of this theme and will certainly be adding support for other more text editors/IDEs.
